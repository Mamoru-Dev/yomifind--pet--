This pet project was created to practice key web development concepts, such as:  
- **Building an SPA** from scratch.  
- **Component-based architecture** with JavaScript classes.  
- Developing a **custom mini-framework**.  
- Implementing **reactivity** using `on-change` for automatic re-rendering on data changes.
