## 📝 About the Project

This pet project was created to practice key web development concepts, such as:  
- **Building an SPA** from scratch.  
- **Component-based architecture** with JavaScript classes.  
- Developing a **custom mini-framework**.  
- Implementing **reactivity** using `on-change` for automatic re-rendering on data changes.  
- Using **Rollup** as a bundler.

The app allows users to search for books by title, view details about matching books, and bookmark their favorites.
